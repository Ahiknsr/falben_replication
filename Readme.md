## Experiment 1

Seventy-two undergraduates (17 male, Mage = 20.82, SD = 3.57) took part in the research. 
The experiment had a 2 (Expectancy: none vs. equal) × 2 (Owner: self vs. friend) mixed design 
with repeated measures on the second factor.

Analysis of the RTs (correct responses) yielded a main effect of Owner
(b = –.004, SE = .001, t = –3.25, p = .001), such that responses were faster to self-owned 
(M = 509 ms, SD = 97 ms) compared with friend-owned (M = 523 ms, SD = 103 ms) items.
  
A significant Expectancy × Owner (b = .004, SE = .001, t = 2.75, p = .006) interaction also
Emerged.

Further analysis of the interaction revealed that when no expectancy was provided, responses were 
faster to self-owned compared with friend-owned objects (b = –.008, SE = .002, t = –4.36, p < .001)

A multilevel logistic regression analysis on the accuracy of responses yielded a main effect of 
Owner (b = –.060, SE = .025, z = –2.40, p = .016), such that responses were more accurate for 
friend-owned (M = 88%, SD = 10%) than self-owned (M = 86%, SD = 12%) items. A significant 
Expectancy × Owner (b = –.185, SE = .025, z = –7.43, p < .001) interaction also emerged. Further analysis 
of the interaction revealed that, when no information about the frequency of trials was provided, responses 
were more accurate to self-owned compared with friend-owned objects (b = .125, SE = .036, z = 3.50, p < .001).

This effect reversed when participants were aware that equal numbers of self-owned and friend-owned 
objects would be presented during the task (b = –.245, SE = .035, z = –7.07, p < .001).

## Experiment 2

In the current study, participants completed three blocks of trials in which the likelihood that self-owned 
and friend-owned objects would be presented was manipulated. Prior to the commencement of each block, a pencil 
sketch of a box (containing varying numbers of pencils and pens) appeared on the screen conveying diagnostic 
information about the frequency of trials during the block (e.g., Block 1, 75% pens and 25% pencils; Block 2, 25%
pens and 75% pencils; Block 3, 50% pens and 50% pencils). The order of presentation of the blocks was counter 
balanced across participants, with each block comprising 224 trials (e.g., Block 1, 168 self-trials and 56 friend-trials; 
Block 2, 56 self-trials and 168 friend-trials; Block 3, 112 self-trials and 112 friend-trials).

A multilevel model analysis of the RTs (correct responses) yielded a main effect of Expectancy 
(b = .003, SE = .001, t = 2.27, p = .023), such that responses were faster for friend-owned (M = 470 ms, SD = 76 ms)
than self-owned (M = 473 ms, SD = 75 ms) items. In addition, a significant Expectancy × Owner (b = –.037, SE = .001, t = –27.76, p < .001) 
interaction emerged (see Figure 2). Further analysis of the interaction revealed that, when self-trials were expected,
responses were faster to self-owned compared with friend-owned objects (b = –.028, SE = .002, t = –14.64, p < .001). 

In contrast, when friend-trials were expected, responses were faster to friend-owned than to self-owned objects 
(b = .034, SE = .002, t = 16.09, p < .001). No difference emerged when self-trials and friend-trials were equally
probable (an additional Bayesian analysis yielded moderate evidence for the null effect, BF01 = 4.69).

A multilevel logistic regression analysis on the accuracy of responses yielded a main effect of Owner 
(b = –.103, SE = .021, z = –5.04, p < .001), such that responses were more accurate to friend-owned (M = 84%, SD = 14%)
than to self-owned (M = 82%, SD = 16%) items. In addition, a significant Expectancy × Owner (b = .912, SE = .027, z = 34.24, p < .001)
interaction emerged (see Figure 2). Further analysis of the interaction revealed that, when self-trials were expected,
responses were more accurate to self-owned compared with friend-owned objects (b = .771, SE = .038, z = 20.33, p < .001).

## Experiment 3

Thirty-six undergraduates (11 male, Mage = 20.14, SD = 1.91) took part in the research. The experiment had 2 (Expectancy: self-expected vs. friend-expected) × 2 (Owner: self vs. friend) repeated-measures design. 

the experiment comprised an object-classification task featuring two categories of objects: pencils and pens. The task closely followed Experiment 2, but with two modifications. First, as stimulus-prioritisation was not observed when self-owned and friend-owned objects were equally likely to be presented during the task (see Experiments 1 and 2), this condition was dropped. Second, across two blocks of trials, although participants expected either self-objects or friend-objects to predominate (e.g., Block 1, 75% self-objects and 25% friend-objects; Block 2, 75% friend-objects and 25% self-objects), in reality the opposite was the case (e.g., Block 1, 25% self-objects and 75% friend-objects; Block 2, 25% friend-objects and 75% self-objects). The order of the experimental blocks was counterbalanced across participants and each block comprised 224 trials (e.g., 168 self-trials and 56 friend-trials).
RT and accuracy. Responses faster than 200 ms were excluded from the analysis, eliminating approximately 2% of the overall number of trials. A multilevel model analysis of the RTs (correct responses) yielded a main effect of Expectancy (b = –.008, SE = .002, t = –4.94, p < .001), such that responses were faster in the self-expected (but friend-predominated) condition (M = 495 ms, SD = 88 ms) than the friend-expected (but self-predominated) condition (M = 514 ms, SD = 92 ms). A main effect of Owner (b = –.003, SE = .002, t = –2.03, p = .042) was also observed,
indicating that RTs were faster to self-owned (M = 501 ms, SD = 86 ms) compared with friend-owned (M = 508 ms, SD = 94 ms) items. Finally, a significant Expectancy × Owner (b = .019, SE = .002, t = 10.95, p < .001) interaction emerged (see Figure 3). Further analysis of the interaction revealed that, when self-trials were expected (but friend-trials predominated), responses were faster to friend-owned compared with self-owned objects (b = .014,
SE = .003, t = 6.07, p < .001). In contrast, when friend-trials were expected (but self-trials predominated), responses were faster to self-owned than to friend-owned objects
(b = –.021, SE = .002, t = –8.44, p < .001).

A multilevel logistic regression analysis on the accuracy of responses reveal a significant Expectancy × Owner (b = –.629, SE = .032, z = –19.95, p < .001) interaction (seeFigure 3). Further analysis of the interaction revealed that,when self-trials were expected (but friend-trials predominated), responses were more accurate to friend-owned compared with self-owned objects (b = –.598, SE = .045, z = –13.23, p < .001). In contrast, when friend-trials were
expected (but self-trials predominated), responses were more accurate to self-owned than to friend-owned objects (b = .671, SE = .044, t = 15.16, p < .001).
